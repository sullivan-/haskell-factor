my first Haskell program

factors a number using [trial division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division). this is
probably the simplest number factoring algorithm imaginable.

this is a rewrite of one of the earliest programs i ever wrote, on my Casio FX-602P programmable
calculator.

a big part of this exercise for me is setting up a basic project layout with Cabal and all that,
including some unit tests.
